My body mothers just about anyone,  

and I promise I can take secrets 

safely through the night. I once carried 

my transness in a secret jean pocket 

for decades. A few times, I even 

sent it through the wash, hoping 

to clean what was never dirty. 

I am done lying. I yearn for those

years. I want to relive my life better.



But mostly, I wish I could tell every 

trans child a story about running through 

the forest shirtless, about how the wind 

licks when only the trees are staring. 

I promise, sunrise can feel sweet. 


If you let it in, love can burn hotter

than summer on pavement. I’ve spent 

winters fevering in love. I’ve autumned

in bandages and blood and my partner 

still kissed my neck, with their molten

mouth. When I was under anesthesia 

my partner was not. I often imagine how 

warm their hands were wringing—

a fire started with no flint at all.  



We could take this love to the forest

and live. We could start a fire even 

in a rain hell bent to erode bed rock. 

When I sleep with my mouth open, 

my partner plants mint, and it grows.
